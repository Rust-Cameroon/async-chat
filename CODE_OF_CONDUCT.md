In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and members of [async chat library](https://github.com/Rust-Cameroon/async-chat), an async chat library built in Rust, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or other characteristics.

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that promote an inclusive, respectful, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Behavior that contributes to a positive environment includes:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences—every design or implementation choice involves trade-offs.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and offering it thoughtfully.
- Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole, not just individuals.
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members.
- Avoiding unstructured critique; if you have ideas to explore, fork the project and experiment.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention/advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, including behaviors outlined in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/citizen-code-of-conduct).
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without explicit permission.
- Spamming, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing actions.
- Conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting or that excludes socially marginalized groups.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for:
- Clarifying these standards of acceptable behavior.
- Taking appropriate and fair corrective action against unacceptable behavior.
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions (e.g., comments, commits, code, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct, with reasons provided when appropriate.
- Temporarily or permanently banning contributors for behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers are held to a higher standard and must model exemplary conduct. Failure to enforce this Code in good faith may lead to repercussions determined by other project leaders.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:
- The GitHub repository ([https://github.com/Rust-Cameroon/async-chat]), issues, pull requests, and discussions.

It also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces, such as:
- Using an official project email address.
- Posting via an official social media account.
- Acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.
Representation may be further defined by maintainers.

## Enforcement
<<<<<<< HEAD
Instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at [yemelechristian2@gmail.com],[abonghoderick@gmail.com] or via a private GitHub Issue/Discussion. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, with a response appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Process
- **Correction**: For minor issues (e.g., inappropriate language), maintainers will issue a private warning, explaining the violation and requesting correction. A public apology may be encouraged.
- **Warning**: For a single incident or pattern of minor issues, a formal warning will be issued, with a period of no interaction with involved parties or maintainers (including external channels like social media).
- **Temporary Ban**: For serious or sustained violations, a temporary ban (e.g., 30 days) from project interaction will be imposed. No contact with the community is allowed during this time.
- **Permanent Ban**: For repeated violations, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or groups, a permanent ban from all project interaction will be enforced.

Bans may be lifted at maintainers’ discretion for first offenses if a genuine apology is offered. Disputes about moderation should be raised privately with maintainers, not publicly.

## Community Expectations
We aim to go beyond technical excellence. Avoid sensitive or offensive topics that could harm trust or drive people away, especially if off-topic. If someone objects to your actions, pause, listen, and apologize—even if you feel misunderstood. It’s your responsibility to ensure others feel comfortable. We assume good intent and encourage forgiveness when trust is earned. Let’s keep the focus on building innovative technology together.
