This project follows the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**, which requires all commits to be signed off.

âœ… How to sign off:

If you're using the command line:

```
git commit -s -m "Commit message"
```
This adds:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

If you forget, no stress â€” you can fix it:

```
git commit --amend -s
git push --force
```
